[vSwarm: A serverless benchmarking suite and methodology 3/8 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztzKhLA7zbc&list=PLVdxPJaekjWqBsEUwnrYRQCaMqvcDVsBE&index=3)

### vSwarm: A suite of serverless applications targeted to benchmark commercial and other state-of-the-art clouds

### What runs in serverless clouds?

Past: Low cost was the key advantage of serverless (price>actual performance)

- Best-effort and non-critical jobs
- Stateless workflows (Transform inputs into outputs throughout the application)

Today : Serverless application domain keeps expanding

- Sporadically invoked and dynamic workloads
- Parallel jobs
- Latency-critical(30%)
- Data-intensive(60%)

Keeping these different class of service applications in mind, 

vSwarm, a comprehensive(幅広い) benchmark suite and methodology

### Existing Cloud and Serverless Benchmarks

Suites of conventional “serverful” workloads

- Examples: SPEC Cloud IaaS, CloudSuite
- Pro: Robust methodology
- Con: Not representative of serverless clouds(because they run different applications)
-
